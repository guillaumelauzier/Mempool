# Mempool

A memory pool, or mempool, is an essential component of a blockchain network that serves as a holding area for transactions awaiting inclusion in a block. Although the structure and features of mempools can differ across various blockchain protocols, several core components are common to most:

### Transaction Queue

This is the main holding area where incoming transactions are stored before being added to a block. Transactions typically enter this queue after being broadcast to the network and are kept here until a miner or validator includes them in a block.

### Transaction Verification

Before a transaction enters the mempool, it often goes through a series of checks to validate its authenticity and completeness. This may include checks for:
- Valid digital signatures
- Sufficient funds (i.e., the sender has enough balance to execute the transaction)
- Correct data format
- Nonce verification to prevent double-spending in some blockchain architectures

### Priority Mechanism

In many blockchains, especially those where the block size is limited, not all transactions can be included in the next block. Therefore, some sort of priority mechanism is usually implemented. This could be based on:
- Transaction fees: Higher fees could mean higher priority.
- Age of transaction: Older transactions could be given priority.
- Specific rules particular to the blockchain.

### Fee Estimation

Some advanced mempools offer fee estimation algorithms that can suggest an appropriate transaction fee based on current network conditions. This helps transactions get processed faster during times of high demand.

### Orphan Transactions Pool

An "orphan" in this context refers to a transaction that refers to another transaction not yet in the blockchain or mempool. Orphan transactions are stored separately and are added to the main queue once their parent transactions are included in the blockchain.

### Double-Spend Detection

To maintain the integrity of the network, the mempool usually checks for double-spending attempts. If a new incoming transaction contradicts an existing transaction in the mempool, one of them is usually discarded or flagged.

### Size Limits

Due to resource constraints, there is often a limit to how many transactions the mempool can hold. Once this limit is reached, either the new incoming transactions are rejected, or lower-priority transactions are removed.

### Eviction Policy

When the mempool reaches its size limit, it may have to evict transactions to make room for new ones. The policy for which transactions to remove can vary, but it often involves removing the transactions with the lowest fees or the ones that have been in the pool for the longest time without being included in a block.

### Broadcasting

The mempool usually has a way to broadcast transactions to other nodes and mempools in the network. This ensures that transactions are propagated across the network for inclusion in the next block.

### Local and Network Mempool

Note that each node in a decentralized network typically maintains its own local mempool. However, the term "mempool" often refers collectively to all such local mempools, which should theoretically converge over time to contain the same set of transactions, barring network latency and other such factors.

These are generalized components, and individual blockchain implementations may add more features or lack some of the above components depending on their design and requirements.
